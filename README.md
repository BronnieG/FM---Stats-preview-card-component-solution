## Overview

This is a great small challenge to help get you used to building to a design. There's no JS in this project, so you'll be able to focus on your HTML & CSS skills.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- @media queries for responsive optimisation

### What I learned

- The basics of how to use a flexbox and what display properties should be set
- I found an awesome background blend option that allows you to add different filters to yoru images.
- How to work with background images
- how to optimise a site for mobile devices.  The challenge only required optimisation for mobile devices, however I added responsive options for tablets.

### Continued development
- The CSS grid option, from my research done with this project, appears to allow more flexibility and make the solution more scalable. Therefor in my next project I will use CSS grid rather that flexbox, and build on these skills going forward.
